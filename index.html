    âœ¨ My Autobiography <br>
    Hi! Iâ€™m Charlene Mae A. Clores, an IT student at Datamex College in Meycauayan, Bulacan. 
    Iâ€™m passionate about technology and love spending my free time watching anime, K-dramas, 
    C-dramas, and J-dramas. Iâ€™m also a big fan of K-pop and P-pop idols. I enjoy learning 
    new things and expressing my creativity through my interests. <br><br> 

    ðŸ‘§ My Early Life <br>
    I was born in Cabanatuan City and raised in Quezon City. Growing up, Iâ€™ve always been 
    curious and imaginative. I loved playing games, exploring new hobbies, and bonding with 
    my family. My childhood was filled with simple joys that shaped who I am today. <br><br> 
        
    ðŸ“š My Education <br>
    I am currently studying Information Technology at Datamex College. I chose this course 
    because Iâ€™m interested in how technology works, especially computers and programming. 
    Itâ€™s challenging, but I enjoy solving problems and building things from scratch.<br><br>

    ðŸ’– My Hobbies and Interests <br>
    In my free time, I love watching anime and dramas from different countries - 
    each story inspires me in different ways. I also support K-pop and P-pop groups 
    because their talent, visuals, and passion really motivate me to keep going. 
    These interests help me express myself and relax after a long day.<br><br>

    ðŸŒ± My Dreams and Goals <br>
    In the future, I hope to become a skilled IT professional. I want to create 
    something meaningful through technology - maybe an app or a website that can help others. 
    I also dream of traveling, discovering new cultures, and continuing to grow as a person.<br><br>
    </p>
